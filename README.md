### Rust

The rust solutions can be found in `2022/rust/`  
They can be ran with `cargo run <day number> <puzzle part>`, eg. `cargo run 1 1` (for day 1, part 1)  
Each puzzle expects a corresponding file in `data/day<number>.txt`, eg. `data/day01.txt`  
Each solution also has tests using the sample input, eg. `cargo test days::day01`
